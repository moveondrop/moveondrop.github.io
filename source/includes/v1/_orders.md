# Orders #

The orders API allows you to create, view of orders.

## Lifecycle of an Order ##

In general, a MoveOn order can go through three statuses during its lifecycle. These are `pending`, `cancelled` and `delivered`.

Once an order has been placed to MoveOn, for each OrderItem a corresponding BuyOrderItem is created at MoveOn end.
An OrderHandler is assigned to this order by MoveOn. At this stage a `BuyInvoice` is generated. Once customer 
pays the `BuyInvoice`, OrderHandler assigns a buying agent to each BuyOrderItem.
Once `BuyingAgent` purchase the item, he sends it to `ShippingAgent` as a ShipmentItem and 
`ShippingAgent` ships the ShipmentItem to MoveOn. At this stage, a `ShipmentInvoice` 
get generated by MoveOn after calculating its weight/quantity based on `warehouse_category` that customer chosen during order placement.

MoveOn manage statuses for BuyOrderItem and ShipmentItem separately. Hence, a BuyOrderItem/ShipmentItem 
may have a different status from another ByOrderItem in that order.

## Status for an order ##
- pending: This indicates that the whole order has not been delivered to the customer yet.
- canceled: This indicates that MoveOn has canceled the full order.
- delivered: Indicates weather, the full order (All order items) has been delivered to the customer.


## Status for an order item ##
- buy-pending: This OrderItem still is in pending state, Either customer hasn't paid the `BuyingInvoce` or OrderHandler hasn't started working on this item.
- buy-approved: This indicates, `OrderHandler` reviewed this item and assigned a `BuyingAgent` to it for further processing.
- buy-processing: This indicates, `BuyingAgent` started working on this OrderItem.
- buy-reject: Indicates, OrderHandler failed to assign a matching `BuyingAgent` to this OrderItem.
- buy-purchased: Indicates, `BuyingAgent` successfully purchased this OrderItem.
- buy-not-purchased: Indicates, `BuyingAgent` failed to purchase this OrderItem.
- handover-to-shipping: Indicates, `BuyingAgent` successfully handed over this OrderItem to `ShippingAgent`. 
- arrived-at-warehouse: Indicates, The OrderItem successfully arrived at `ShippingAgent` warehouse. At this stage, a corresponding `ShipmentItem` is created at MoveOn end
- preparing-for-transport: Shipping agent prepared the OrderItem for transport.
- handover-to-airline: The OrderItem is handed over to airline for Air shipment if `shipping_type` of chosen warehouse category is `air`.
- arrived-at-destination-airport: The OrderItem is arrived at destination airport.
- customs-released: The OrderItem get clearance from customs.
- received-by-moveon: Indicates that, MoveOn received this OrderItem. Once MoveOn recalculate the weight/quantity for this ShipmentItem, an `ShippingInvoice` get created.

Once the customer paid the `ShippingInvoice`, he can create delivery request for the OrderItem.
